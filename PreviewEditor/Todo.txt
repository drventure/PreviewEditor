Looks like a decent file viewer component, also WPF
https://github.com/woanware/LogViewer2

In SiteEditor, the editor is loaded with the file when the PARENTCHANGED event happens
Need to change this because that prevents me from leaving the LOADING in place while the editor loads VERY large files.
Also, need to make the loading of the document ASYNC and CANCELLABLE.

All settings are saved anytime one changes, need to queue up saves and only save after a few seconds.
Also save needs to automatically occur before shutdown

Rework syntax defs to use consistent token names (to make it easier to map VSCode or VS themes to here)

Add code to load syntax defs from file system if available.

Finish up Find replace panel.

Highlight all occurrences as you type

Count all occurrences and show which you're at as you type (like VSCODE). For Replace

Show find, click back to editor, press esc, should close find.

Build in support to override the syntax rules with new ones. I updated the Dark-CSharp with Operators, but need to get it embedded


DONE
=====================
Count all occurrences and show which you're at as you type (like VSCODE). For Find
Move AvalonEdit code into main project to reduce another dependent DLL



MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE
=====================

Need to create each editor when necessary and cache it between invocations on viewing files, so that 
we don't create a new viewer each time.
Looks like the host is responsible for newing up the previewers and DOPUS at least creates one fresh
every time so there's no way to cache them.
